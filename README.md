2-Month Data Engineering Interview Prep Plan (Flink + GCP)

Week 1: Kafka Deep Dive

[ ] Understand Kafka architecture (brokers, partitions, offsets, replication)

[ ] Explore Kafka producers and consumers in Java

[ ] Work with Kafka CLI and Docker setup

[ ] Use Kafka Connect (e.g., GCS sink connector)

[ ] Practice interview Qs: fault tolerance, backpressure, ordering


Week 2: Flink Fundamentals (Part 1)

[ ] Learn Flink architecture (JobManager, TaskManager)

[ ] Use DataStream API: source → transform → sink

[ ] Write a simple Flink Java job: Kafka → map → console

[ ] Explore Flink SQL (optional)

[ ] Compare Flink vs Kafka Streams vs Spark Streaming

[ ] Practice interview Qs: event time vs processing time


Week 3: Flink Advanced (Part 2)

[ ] Understand windows: tumbling, sliding, session

[ ] Learn stateful processing & checkpointing

[ ] Handle watermarks and late data

[ ] Build Kafka → Flink → BigQuery pipeline (via GCS or Dataflow)

[ ] Practice interview Qs: exactly-once, late data handling


Week 4: GCP Core – GCS, BigQuery, IAM

[ ] Explore GCS: object storage, lifecycle rules, access control

[ ] BigQuery: partitioning, clustering, query optimization

[ ] Use bq CLI and web UI

[ ] Run queries over GCS-ingested data

[ ] Practice interview Qs: cost control, IAM, security


Week 5: dbt + GCP Data Pipelines

[ ] Learn dbt basics: models, refs, sources, snapshots, tests

[ ] Implement incremental models and materializations

[ ] Build GCS → BigQuery external table → dbt model pipeline

[ ] Practice interview Qs: data quality, documentation


Week 6: Java for Data Engineering

[ ] Refresh Java: collections, Streams API, exception handling, concurrency

[ ] Use Kafka/Flink Java client libraries

[ ] Write a Kafka → Flink streaming job with basic state

[ ] Build utility classes (e.g., schema validator)

[ ] Practice interview Qs: memory management, robust code


Week 7: System Design & Scenario Questions

[ ] Design: real-time pipeline (Kafka → Flink → BigQuery)

[ ] Discuss hybrid batch-streaming pipelines

[ ] Handle schema evolution, retries, deduplication

[ ] Practice whiteboard/system design interviews daily


Week 8: Resume + Final Revisions

[ ] Finalize resume (focus on impact, stack, projects)

[ ] Prepare STAR-format walkthroughs for 3–5 key projects

[ ] Revisit tough topics (e.g., Flink state, watermarking)

[ ] Do light LeetCode practice (easy/medium Java Qs)

[ ] Conduct 2–3 mock interviews (peers or platforms)
