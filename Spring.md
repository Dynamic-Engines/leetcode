Yes, Spring Framework (especially Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Spring Data) is heavily tested at JPMorgan Chase VP-level interviews. They expect deep understanding‚Äînot just usage‚Äîespecially around Spring internals, dependency injection, microservices patterns, security, and real-world architecture decisions.

‚úÖ Frequently Asked Spring Questions at JPMorgan (with Answers)


---

üîπ 1. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller?

Answer:

All are stereotype annotations for component scanning, but semantically different:

Annotation	Used For	Special Behavior

@Component	Generic Spring bean	Base annotation for others
@Service	Business logic	Better suited for service-layer exceptions
@Repository	Persistence layer	Enables automatic exception translation (JPA)
@Controller	Web layer (MVC)	Works with @RequestMapping, returns view
@RestController	REST APIs	Combines @Controller + @ResponseBody



---

üîπ 2. How does Spring Dependency Injection work internally?

Answer:

Spring uses IoC container (ApplicationContext) to manage beans.

Injection happens via:

Constructor Injection

Setter Injection

Field Injection (not recommended for testability)


Beans are created during context startup or lazily.

Uses reflection to inject dependencies.

Bean scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session.



---

üîπ 3. What is the difference between @Autowired and @Qualifier?

Answer:

@Autowired injects a matching bean by type.

@Qualifier("beanName") is used to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist.


@Autowired
@Qualifier("myBean")
private Service service;


---

üîπ 4. How does Spring Security handle authentication and authorization?

Answer:

Authentication: Validates credentials (e.g., via DB, LDAP, JWT).

Authorization: Restricts access using @PreAuthorize, roles, URL patterns.

Uses SecurityFilterChain, AuthenticationManager, UserDetailsService.



---

üîπ 5. Explain Spring Boot Auto Configuration.

Answer:

Uses @EnableAutoConfiguration and spring.factories/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration.

Auto-detects classes in classpath and configures beans conditionally.

Example: If H2 is in classpath, auto configures an in-memory DB.



---

üîπ 6. Difference between @Transactional and propagation types?

Answer:

@Transactional manages DB transactions.

Propagation Types:

REQUIRED: Join existing or create new

REQUIRES_NEW: Always starts new

NESTED: Nested transaction

SUPPORTS, MANDATORY, NOT_SUPPORTED, NEVER




---

üîπ 7. How would you secure a REST API using JWT and Spring Security?

Answer (summary):

Intercept requests via OncePerRequestFilter.

Extract & validate JWT token.

Authenticate user via UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.

Stateless: No sessions; all info is in the token.



---

üîπ 8. How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot REST APIs?

Answer:

Global: @ControllerAdvice + @ExceptionHandler

Per-controller: @ExceptionHandler inside controller

Use ResponseEntityExceptionHandler for built-ins

Customize HTTP status, error messages



---

üîπ 9. What is Spring AOP? Use case?

Answer:

Aspect-Oriented Programming: Cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security)

Uses: @Aspect, @Around, @Before, @AfterReturning

Common use cases: Auditing, Logging, Transactions, Security



---

üîπ 10. How would you scale a Spring Boot microservice?

Answer:

Stateless services

Use Redis for caching/session/token

Load balancing with API Gateway (e.g., Zuul/Spring Cloud Gateway)

Externalize config with Spring Cloud Config

Monitor with Actuator + Prometheus/Grafana
