✅ JPMorgan Java VP-Level – Design Patterns Questions & Answers


---

🔹 1. Which design patterns have you used in your microservices?

✅ What to say:

> I've commonly used Singleton (for beans and service factories), Strategy (for extensible business logic like payment or rule engines), Template Method (for workflow steps), and Builder (for constructing complex DTOs or entities). Also used Factory, Observer, and Circuit Breaker (from Resilience4j).

🔹 2. Explain the Strategy Pattern with a real use case.

Scenario: Dynamic logic based on user role or region (e.g., different tax calculators).

public interface TaxCalculator {
    double calculateTax(double income);
}

public class IndiaTax implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double income) {
        return income * 0.18;
    }
}

public class USATax implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double income) {
        return income * 0.25;
    }
}

public class TaxService {
    private TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

    public TaxService(TaxCalculator taxCalculator) {
        this.taxCalculator = taxCalculator;
    }

    public double getTax(double income) {
        return taxCalculator.calculateTax(income);
    }
}

🔹 3. When would you use the Factory vs Abstract Factory Pattern?

Pattern	Use Case

Factory	To create objects based on input or context (e.g., NotificationFactory.create("SMS"))
Abstract Factory	To group related factories (e.g., UI toolkit with ButtonFactory, TextFieldFactory) for platform-specific UI



---

🔹 4. Explain the Singleton Pattern in Spring.

✅ In Spring, all beans are Singleton by default.

Problem with Singleton in multithreading (outside Spring):

public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton();
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

> Note: volatile + double-checked locking ensures thread safety.




---

🔹 5. What is the Observer Pattern? When have you used it?

✅ Used for: Messaging (event publishing), microservices communication, GUI.

public interface Observer {
    void update(String eventData);
}

public class EmailService implements Observer {
    public void update(String eventData) {
        System.out.println("Sending email: " + eventData);
    }
}

public class EventPublisher {
    List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void register(Observer o) {
        observers.add(o);
    }

    public void notifyAll(String data) {
        for (Observer o : observers) o.update(data);
    }
}

🔹 6. Explain the Template Method Pattern in Java.

✅ Use when the algorithm skeleton stays the same but steps vary.

public abstract class DataProcessor {
    public void process() {
        readData();
        transformData();
        saveData();
    }

    abstract void readData();
    abstract void transformData();
    void saveData() { System.out.println("Saved to DB"); }
}

public class CSVProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    void readData() { System.out.println("Read CSV"); }
    void transformData() { System.out.println("Transform CSV"); }
}


---

🔹 7. Circuit Breaker is which pattern?

✅ It is a Proxy + State + Strategy pattern.

Used via libraries like Resilience4j, e.g.:

@CircuitBreaker(name = "inventoryService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
public String checkInventory(String productId) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://inventory/api/" + productId, String.class);
}


---

🔹 8. Decorator Pattern – Use case in Spring?

✅ Example: Filter chain in Spring Security.

public interface Notifier {
    void send(String msg);
}

public class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {
    public void send(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Email: " + msg);
    }
}

public class SMSDecorator implements Notifier {
    private Notifier notifier;

    public SMSDecorator(Notifier notifier) {
        this.notifier = notifier;
    }

    public void send(String msg) {
        notifier.send(msg);
        System.out.println("SMS: " + msg);
    }
}


---

🔹 9. Builder Pattern – When do you use it?

✅ When building immutable objects with many fields.

public class User {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    private final String phone;

    private User(Builder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.phone = builder.phone;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private int age;
        private String phone;

        public Builder name(String name) { this.name = name; return this; }
        public Builder age(int age) { this.age = age; return this; }
        public Builder phone(String phone) { this.phone = phone; return this; }

        public User build() { return new User(this); }
    }
}

🔹 10. Which patterns are used in Spring Boot internals?

Pattern	Usage in Spring Boot

Singleton	Beans lifecycle
Factory	BeanFactory, ApplicationContext
Proxy	AOP (method interceptors), Transactional
Template Method	JdbcTemplate, RestTemplate
Observer	ApplicationEvents, Listeners
Strategy	AuthenticationManager, TokenResolvers
Builder	ResponseEntity builder, URI builder, DTO creation
